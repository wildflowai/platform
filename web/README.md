# Wildflow demo UI

This is main demo UI. Once [graphql](/graphql/) API is ready, this will be rebuilt from scratch using [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com).

## Dev

1. Run `npm start` to run the app in dev mode locally.

This should open http://localhost:3000 in the browser.

2. To deploy, update firebase config for your project and then run `npm run build:prod`.
